# GematriaForTruthDates
Gematria For Truth API Support for Generated Date Spans. Used mainly in numerology for discovering relationships between two event dates given variable calendar numbers. For exaple 2/22/2022 occurs exactly 222 years, 222 months, 222 weeks, and 322 dates after July 4, 1776.  Includes console app example.


The Gematria For Truth platform is an attempt to create a variety of free SDK's for the purpose of creating tools in the field of gematria and numerology discovery. This package is the base package for Gematria Ciphers and Decoding. There is still much work to be done in regards to documentation.

Included is a example console app implementing the various features for Generated Date Spans.  Generated Date Spans will integrate with the next repository due to be released, WikiData Events.

Other packages and repositories will soon be available for,

->Mongo DB Support

->Date Analysis

->WikiData integration

->Web Crawling (gathering of phrases)

->Web Page Analysis

->PDF Analysis

->Date Generation

->Bible and Scripture Analysis

->Word Matching bases on cipher value matches

->And more...

Currently there is a Windows Forms User interface in a somewhat beta release stage build on the platform.
